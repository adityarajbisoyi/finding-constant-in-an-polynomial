# finding-constant-in-an-polynomial
* Converting the given value from arbitrary "base" into decimal (base 10).
* Decode the x,y value.
* Use lagrange interpolation to calculate the constant term(a term with x^0).

-> The explaination is more clear in the cPlusPlus code, I have added some comments in it.
